    Until now, these are the assets and scripts we have used. As assets we have used digital vectorial drawings made by us. These represent icons for coins, all the vegetables, seeds, weapons and so on. In the scrip section we implemented the scene change, exit button, buy and sell functions. For the moment, the sell function is not well done implemented, because we can sell things more than we have in the inventory.
